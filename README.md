# server.properties
Sometimes it's hard to dig throught documentation, all the possible settings, finding them and understanding what they do when you're setting up your custom Minecraft server.

This app is designed to have everytghing in one place, with intuitive controls, simple design and tooltips.

# Usage
For now, you need to clone the repo locally, and run `npm run dev` with NodeJS installed, and all the dependencies (via running `npm install` in root folder of the project). After that, you can visit `http://localhost:5000` to test the site, or follow number of guides online to deploy your instance of the app.

Or, you can simply visit (WIP) and check it online :) 

It's really simple; just go throught settings, set what variables you want to change to whatever you like, and at the bottom, there is a pre-formatted text area from which you just copy all the text, paste it into `server.properties` and voil√†, you're good to go.
